#MAGD 150
Here's some code I've made over the fall semester in MAGD 150

##Ping
This [code](https://github.com/raywr15/MAGD-150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab06_Ray_2021_12_09_22_37_08) is a simple version of pong but it goes from the top to the bottom so I call it Ping. This game consists of two players controlling the paddles with 'a' and 's' or 'j' and 'k'.

##City Design
In this [design](https://github.com/raywr15/MAGD-150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab10_Ray_2021_12_09_22_29_45) I've created a map of a city. In the design there is a movable camera that allows the user to look around the city. 


##Mirrors
In this[code](https://github.com/raywr15/MAGD-150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab09_Ray_2021_12_09_22_32_48), it uses video capture to get the users video and creates "mirror" of themselves in different filters. It also has a button that alllows for reverbed music to be played

##TV Remote
In this [design](https://github.com/raywr15/MAGD-150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab05_Ray_2021_12_09_22_38_03), I made a interactive remote that turns on the tv and a pause/play button. When the buttons are pressed the TV responses with either turning on, being paused, or a simple screen that the TV is on.

##Movie Poster
In this [poster](https://github.com/raywr15/MAGD-150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/Poster_2021_12_09_22_34_58), I made my own Star Wars Revenge of the Sith poster where it shows the light and dark side of the chosen one. This is displayed by being on one side of the lightsaber.
